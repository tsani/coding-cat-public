You are working as a non-teaching assistant in a school. The principal gives you lists of students for various classes. Your task is to rearrange the list in an alphabetical order as well as create a new list in which each student will have a roll number according to the alphabetical order of their names. However, if you get an empty list or empty string (no name or string is empty), give the output “Invalid List”.

For example:
- `assign_roll_numbers([“James”, “Eric”, “Antman”]) → [[1, “Antman”], [2, “Eric”], [3, “James”]]`
- `assign_roll_numbers([“Khan”, “Singh”, “Maha”, “Karl”]) → [[1, “Karl”], [2, “Khan”], [3, “Maha”], [4, “Singh”]]`
- `assign_roll_numbers([“A”, “Aa”, “a”]) → [[1, “A”], [2, “Aa”], [3, “a”]]`
