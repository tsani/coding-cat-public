Write a function 'same_adjacent(str, char)' that takes in a string and a single character. Return the number of times that the single character appears in the string, but only if it appears next to itself.

For example: 
- If the string is hello and the character is l, adjacent("hello", "l") should return you 2.
- If the string is test and the character is t, adjacent("test", "t") should return you 0.
- If the string is aabbaa and the character is a, adjacent("aabbaa", "a") should return you 4.
