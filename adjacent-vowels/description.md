Write a function that takes as input a `string` and returns the numbers times two `consecutive` vowels appear back-to-back. Count each pair of *adjacent* vowels. We define vowels as any letter a, e, i, o or u case insensitively.
____
For example:
```
* adjacent_vowels("heahea") -> 2 ("ea" and "ea")
* adjacent_vowels("LeAeA") -> 3 ("ea", "Ae" and "eA")
* adjacent_vowels("EricMayhew") -> 0 (No Adjacent vowels)
```
