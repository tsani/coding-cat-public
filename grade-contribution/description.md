Write a function `grade_contribution(grade: float, weight: float) -> float` that takes two inputs: `grade` (a float representing the grade received) and `weight` (a float representing the weight of that grade as a percentage of the final grade). The function should return the _contribution_ of that grade towards the final grade. 

For example, if the inputs are `85.0` and `20.0`, the output should be `17.0` because `85` with a weight of `20%` contributes `17` to the final grade.
