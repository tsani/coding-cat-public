Write a function `dating_filter(height: float, eye_color: str, job: str) -> bool` that takes three inputs: `height` (a float representing the height in feet), `eye_color` (a string representing the color of the eyes), and `job` (a string representing the job). The function should return `True` if the inputs match the criteria of "6 foot" height, "blue" eyes, and "finance" job. Otherwise, it should return `False`. For example, if the inputs are `6.0`, `"blue"`, and `"finance"`, the output should be `True`.
