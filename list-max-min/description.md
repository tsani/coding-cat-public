Given a list, write a function `list_max_min(nums)` that returns another list that contains repeated results of the additions of the smallest value to the biggest value. The elements of the new list need to sum up to less than 30. Assume the list will be of length 2 or more.

- Make sure to deal with the correct sum of the new list
- <em> Note: </em> If the sum of the minimum and maximum value of a list is less or equal to 0, the function should return 0.

For example:

- If `num` is `[3, 4, 6, 5]`, the output is `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
- If `num` is `[2, 5, 4, 3]`, the output is `[7, 7, 7, 7]`
- If `num` is `[0, 0, 0]`, the output is `0`
