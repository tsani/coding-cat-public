Dawson is lucky in that we have a lot of greenspace in downtown Montreal. However, just because we
have a nice campus doesn't mean it's always the best to go outside. 

Write a function that determines is it's a good idea to eat outside. Return true if it is summer
and not raining, otherwise return false.
