Given a string, return a new string where each character with an even index is uppercase, and each character with an odd index is lowercase. Hint: The use of .upper() and .lower() functions might be needed.  

 

upper_even_i("hello) -> "HeLlO" 

upper_even_i("Darling') -> "DaRlInG" 

upper_even_i("computer") -> "CoMpUtEr
